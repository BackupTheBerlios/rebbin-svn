TODO
----

* check tests with mysql
* add comments feature to pastes
* error messages for form validation
* rework theme
* admin ui (list, edit, delete) (?)
* multiple versions (?)
* replace external highlighter with plain ruby code (far in the future :))
* store html body in db (?) - cause it does mean that we tie the app to the external colouriser
* add sqlite support
