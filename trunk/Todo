* full text search, see also http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SearchGenerator
* error messages for form validation
* rework theme
* admin ui (list, edit, delete) (?)
* multiple versions (?)
* replace external highlighter with plain ruby code (far in the future :))
* improve sorting of archive view, see: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SortHelper and http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SortHelper2
* support pagination in archive view, see: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/PaginationHelper
* integrate calendar helper in the app (?) http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/CalendarHelper
* store html body in db (?) - cause it does mean that we tie the app to the external colouriser
